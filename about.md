It’s on the front page of today’s Daily Prophet – delivered by owl, obviously. “Hogwarts is Coming to Hannahs!”

Grab your wand and prepare to hop on your Nimbus 3000, as a stunning exhibition called Illustrating Harry Potter comes to the Seale-Hayne site this summer (July – September), showcasing original illustrations, sketches, models and final prints from the brand new edition of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, illustrated by Jim Kay.

The spellbinding exhibition has been put together by Seven Stories: The National Centre for Children’s Books in Newcastle (where the exhibition is currently running), and Bloomsbury Children’s Books.

Jim Kay was personally selected by J.K. Rowling to bring her wizarding world alive with his dazzling illustrations. Over the next few years, Jim will be reimagining all seven books, with the first now available in a beautiful hardback edition.

### "Seeing Jim Kay’s illustrations moved me profoundly. I love his interpretation of Harry Potter’s world, and I feel honoured and grateful that he has lent his talent to it.""

Visitors will be able to pore over intricate sketches and stunning pencil drawings and discover Jim’s complex, creative process from inspiration to final illustration. Best of all, fans will be able to come face-to-face with breath-taking portraits of their favourite characters from Hogwarts…let’s hope they stay in their frames!

**With a sprinkling of Floo Powder, the exquisite exhibition will allow fans to be transported into the enchanting world of Harry Potter and includes:**

- Jim’s model of the Hogwarts Express
- impressive concept artwork of iconic scenes and characters
- a short film revealing how he approached illustrating J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
- final oil on board artwork of Professors McGonagall and Dumbledore

Jim Kay is the 2012 Kate Greenaway Medal winning illustrator of A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness whose impressive illustrative style is atmospheric and haunting. Jim loves to work with print but turned to watercolour and pencil for his more recent work. His beautiful new illustrated edition of the nation’s favourite children’s book is brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling’s timeless classic, captivating fans and new readers alike.

Hannahs at Seale-Hayne (just outside Newton Abbot) is the *first venue* to host the exhibition, since it opened in Newcastle at the end of 2015. The exhibition will be the inspiration of a whole summer of magical events, with more details coming soon.

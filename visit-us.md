#### By Car

We are on the A383 between Newton Abbot and Ashburton, just off the main A38. Look for the lay-by about half way along the road and turn opposite. If you Google the site (TQ12 6NQ) – we will come up as the University of Plymouth Campus. Be careful as your SatNav could take you into sides roads.

#### From Plymouth

Travel along the main A38 and keep going to the top of the hill and a little way along the straight. Take to A383 to Newton Abbot (LEFT). Keep on this road until you go past a big grey house on the right -signal early – fast road. You will see the lay-by a little further along on the right – you need to turn LEFT opposite the lay-by. Keep going to the top of the hill.

#### From Exeter

Travel along the main A38 until you get to the Stover Park exit (Trago Mills). A382. Keep going along the main road- at the first roundabout bear left. At the second roundabout turn right. At the third roundabout turn right this sends you to the A383 – Ashburton. Keep going on this road until you start to go back out of the town. Look for New Houses being built Left and Right of the road. You are now going down a steep hill – signal early – fast road. At the bottom of the hill turn Right opposite the lay-by. Keep going to the top of the Lane. No mistaking the building – its beautiful!!

Where possible please car share, details of the local service can be found at carsharedevon.com

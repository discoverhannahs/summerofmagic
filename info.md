## Make the most of your wizarding visit!

**The magical exhibition will be open daily from 10am till 5pm and costs just £2 (under 8s free).** Tickets can be bought from Hannahs Gift Shop, which will also feature a sorcerous selection of spellbinding Harry Potter-themed gifts and treats.

Our Bistro will be open daily (look out for regular Harry Potter Specials), while you can also buy Magic Picnic Boxes (with a free treat) from our pantry, as well as some rather yummy ice-creams and lollypops.

**Treasure Hunt Quiz Sheets** can also be brought from our Gift Shops for £2 each and include a delicious sweet treat. You can also explore our Dragon’s Maze in the quad (built by artist Stefan Jennings) and hunt for our sensory Dragon Eggs.

New events are being added all the time, so please keep an eye on this website.

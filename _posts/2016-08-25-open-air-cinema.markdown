**Mamma Mia**

Dig out your best 70s ABBA or Greek holiday chic outfits, get your vocal chords nice and relaxed (Ouzo apparently helps…) and prepare for the party of the summer. We’ll even be organising a big ‘Zorba the Greek’ dance before the screening to get everyone warmed up!

**Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie**

Sweetie darling, you really must join Patsy and Edina for their big screen debut, which sees the PR mavens fleeing abroad when they accidentally kill Kate Moss. Fabulous catwalk attire and pointless sunglasses most welcome.

**Top Gun**

30 years after Goose, Maverick, Iceman and the rest of the Top Gun pilots first felt the need for speed, they are ready for another flyby, before heading right off into that danger zone. 80’s fashion welcome. 80’s party tunes and volleyball fun ahead of the screening.

## Kids Afternoon Cinema Club

As it gets dark late in the summer and we can’t do an outdoor screening specifically aimed at children, we have been asked to put on a kids cinema club. With this in mind, we will be screening two popular films in the Great Hall, perfect to combine with a visit to the Harry Potter Exhibition.

**Indoors in The Great Hall. 2pm. £4 per person**

*Saturday 27 August*
**Paddington**

Teddy Bear’s Picnic Screening (feel free to bring your own teddy bear and marmalade sandwiches!)

Don't miss the drop-in sessions perfect for young wizards or curious muggles (or indeed anyone young at heart!). Join us in the quad (or inside in the unlikely event of rain) and learn how to make a fantastic wand, a mini marauders map and spellbinding golden snitch.

**10am & 12.30pm. Drop-in anytime. Sessions are just Â£5 and you can take your marvellous creations with you.**

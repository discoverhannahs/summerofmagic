We have teamed up with the South Devon Railway to offer a magical round-robin trip as part of Harry Potter celebrations. Jump on board at Buckfastleigh and enjoy a steam train journey to Totnes, followed by a journey on a London Double Decker Bus up to Hannahs, entry to the exhibition, as well as our Dragon’s Maze and treasure hunt. You’ll then be dropped back to Buckfastleigh on the bus. Expect fun and surprises along the way, while wizarding fancy dress is encouraged.

**Board the special carriage at Buckfastleigh at 10.30am and 2pm. Returning for 2pm and 5.30pm. Adults £18, Child (Under 10) £15. Booking essential**

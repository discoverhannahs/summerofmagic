**The Demon of the Well**

> “Avaunt ye now thou senseless thing, be gone from where ye dwell
For in the deep and darkness lives the Demon of the Well”

Staff at the School of Sorcery are concerned. A visiting Professor from the University of Magick has been found dead next to an old well in an abandoned cellar at the school. He had been researching the history of a Demon who was said to live at the bottom of the Well and who, legend has it, demanded two human souls every one hundred years.

It had been almost exactly one hundred years ago since two pupils at the school had been found dead at the edge of the well having, apparently, fallen down the steps that led to the cellar. The cellar had been sealed and was only re-opened for the, now dead, visiting Professor.

Could it have been the Demon? Or was it someone using the Demon as a cloak to cover a murder? The legend suggested that two souls were demanded, so would there be a second death?

The staff at the school, together with the help of the guests present, are determined to get to the truth before the evening is out. All the clues will be there, but will they be correctly deduced?

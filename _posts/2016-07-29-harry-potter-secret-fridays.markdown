Each Friday over the summer holidays, Play Torbay (joined by their magical Junior Play Rangers) will be presenting exciting hour long activity sessions inspired by Harry Potter. As well as (optional) dressing up, games and songs, children will also get to take part in an art activity and take home their Harry Potter-themed creations. Each week will be a different theme, so children could end up making wands, designing fantastic beasts, making their own magic wallet (complete with Hogwarts money), designing their own crest or creating their very own marauders map.

*Friday 29 July*
**Transfiguration and Magical Creatures**

After being put into teams using the magic sorting hat, children will then get to play a spellbinding sculpting game before making a wand and a mini owl to take home!

*Friday 5 August*
**Defense Against the Dark Arts**

After being put into teams using the magic sorting hat, children will then get to design a house crest, make a wizard or witches hat and then have their photo taken to become a magic portrait!

*Friday 12 August*
**Magical charms**

After being put into teams using the magic sorting hat, children will then get to make some Hogwarts money and a magic wallet – but this isn’t just any wallet and nothing is as it seems.

*Friday 19 August*
**Disappearing, Reappearing and Hogwart Herbology**

After being put into teams using the magic sorting hat, children will be challenged to uncover the hidden message on the Mauraders Map, before heading outside on a treasure hunt to collect the magic objects.

*Friday 26 August*
**Spells**

After being into teams using the magic sorting hat, children will be able to make their own quill pen and practice their penmanship, before trying out some spells. Aparecium reveals invisible ink, Avifors turns small objects into birds, or what about creating your own spell?

Each Friday over the summer holidays, Play Torbay (joined by their magical Junior Play Rangers) will be presenting exciting hour long activity sessions inspired by Harry Potter. Each week will be a different theme, so children could end up making wands, designing fantastic beasts or creating their very own marauders map.

**Meet in the main arch. Sessions at 10am, 11am, 12pm, 2pm, 3pm & 4pm. Aimed at ages 6-12, but siblings welcome. £5 per child. Booking highly advised. Call 01626 325800**

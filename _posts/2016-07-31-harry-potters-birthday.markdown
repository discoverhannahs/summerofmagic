To celebrate the birthdays of both Harry Potter and JK Rowling, we are hosting a very special picnic event. Ride on a miniature steam train, meet an owl, bounce on a castle, explore our dragon maze, enjoy a story walk, tackle our inflatable obstacle course, slide down our big slide, play party games and enjoy a delicious picnic.

**12pm – 2pm.  Pre-booking of picnics essential. Call 01626 325800. Children’s Wizard Picnic Boxes £3.95, Adult Picnics £4.95.  Picnic moved indoors in the event of wet weather. With thanks to Plymouth Miniature Steam and Torbay owls.**

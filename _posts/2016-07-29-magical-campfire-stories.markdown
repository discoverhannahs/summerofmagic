Storytelling around the campfire with hot chocolate to drink and marshmallows to toast.

We are delighted to welcome professional storyteller Gary Cordingley, who has a background in street theatre, drama and music. Before moving down to the South West at the start of this summer, he worked in schools across the North East, as well as Seven Stories, the National Centre For Children’s Books in Newcastle. This promises to be a truly magical evening and tickets are strictly limited, so please don’t miss out.

**Meet under the Main Arch at 6pm. £5 adults, £3 children. Places strictly limited. To book call: 01626 325800**
